    Heterodynes:
        description: "Heterodynes occur above and below the high-frequency component of biphonic calls. 
        The frequency of a heterodyne is equal to the frequency of the fundamental frequency or a harmonic of the high-frequency component plus or minus the frequency of the fundamental frequency or a harmonic of the low-frequency component.
        This means, if you see frequency contours between harmonics of the high-frequency component and you can get the frequencies of these contours by taking the frequency of an adjacent harmonic of the high-frequency component and adding or substracting the frequency of the low-frequency component (once or twice or more times) then it is probably a heterodyne.
        In mathematical terms: frequency(Xth heterodyne above/below high-frequency component) = frequency(high-frequency component) +/- X * frequency(fundamental frequency of low-frequency component) , X is an integer.
        In the rest of this document, when I write about a heterodyne being 'affiliated' to a harmonic of a high-frequency component, this means that the frequency of that heterodyne can be calculated by using that harmonic of the high-frequency component.
        For more information on heterodynes and examples, see:

        This layer group contains 13 layers ('unsure', '0', '1', '2', ..., '12'). These layers are used to draw the contours of heterodynes. 
        Below, the 'unsure' layer and the '0', '1' and '2' layers are described. Those heterodynes that are affiliated with the same contour of the high-frequency component are drawn on the same layer.
        The layers 3-12 are not explained since it works the same as for the layers 0-2."

    Subharmonics:
        description: "Subharmonics occur at evenly spaced intervals below the fundamental frequency and harmonics of a call. 
        The frequency of subharmonics is equal to the fundamental frequency of a call divided by an integer (e.g. f0/2, f0/3, ...).
